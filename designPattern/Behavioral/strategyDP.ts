 * Strategy Design Pattern
 * 
 * Definition: The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, 
 * put each one into a separate class, and makes their objects interchangeable â€” allowing the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that 
 * use it.
